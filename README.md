# wwDotnetBridge
### .NET Interop made easy for Visual FoxPro 9

wwDotnetBridge is a small library designed to make it easy to **call .NET components from Visual FoxPro**. By providing an easy mechanism for loading .NET components and calling them without requiring explicit COM registration of .NET components, it's easy to add .NET functionality to your applications. Interact with core .NET framework components, access both free or commercial 3rd party **libraries**, or build and access your own .NET components from FoxPro all without having to register components via COM.

wwDotnetBridge also provides a host of tools to make it possible to access .NET type features that FoxPro and COM alone do not natively support. For example, native COM interop cannot access components with multiple constructors, cannot access Value, Static or Generic members and types. wwDotnetBridge can automatically convert some problem types, and provides wrapper types that allow access to most unsupported feature types. There's also a powerful ComArray class that makes it easy to interact and manipulate .NET arrays and collections, and a ComValue class that lets you assign and pass .NET values without ever touching FoxPro code.

#### wwDotnetBridge and .NET Versions
> The current version of wwDotnetBridge is compiled for .NET 4.5 and works with:
>
> * .NET 4.5 or later
> * Windows 7 and newer
> * Windows Server 2008 R2 and newer
>
> For support of Windows XP, Server 2003 and 2008 **you have to use [Version 6.0 of wwDotnetBridge](https://github.com/RickStrahl/wwDotnetBridge/releases/tag/v6.0)** which the last version that was compiled with **.NET 4.0** that can run XP, Vista, Server2003/2008. Note that you can use the new version just fine for loading .NET 1.1, 2.0 and 4.0 compiled assemblies.

## Getting Started
Somewhere in the startup of your application call `InitializeDotnetVersion()`:

```foxpro
*** Load dependencies and add to Procedure stack
*** Make sure wwDotnetBridge.prg wwDotnetBridge.dll wwIPStuff.dll 
*** are in your FoxPro path
DO wwDotnetBridge
InitializeDotnetVersion("V4") 
```

This ensures that wwDotnetBridge loads with the specified **single version of the .NET Runtime** that your FoxPro application can load.

> #### @icon-warning  Unable to load CLR Instance Errors
> If you get an  <b>Unable to CLR Instance</b> error when creating an instance of wwDotnetBridge, you probably need to unblock the wwdotnetbridge.dll or need to ensure that the wwdotnetbridge.dll and wwipstuff.dll are in your FoxPro path. Please see [Unable to load CLR Instance](https://www.west-wind.com/webconnection/wwClient_docs/_3rf12jtma.htm) for more info.

Then when you need to utilize wwDotnetBridge call `GetwwDotnetBridge()` to get a cached instance and use it to access .NET components:

```foxpro
*** Create or get cached instance of wwdotnetbridge
LOCAL loBridge as wwDotnetBridge, loHttp
loBridge = GetwwDotnetBridge()

*** Create a built-in .NET class and run a method
loHttp = loBridge.CreateInstance("System.Net.WebClient")
loHttp.DownloadFile("http://west-wind.com/files/MarkdownMonsterSetup.exe",
                    "MarkdownMonsterSetup.exe")
DO wwUtils
GoUrl(FULLPATH("MarkdownMonsterSetup.exe"))  && run it

*** Load a custom .NET assembly
loBridge.LoadAssembly("CustomDotnet.dll")

*** Access a .NET component from the new assembly
loItem = loBridge.CreateInstance("Custom.Item")

*** Access properties directly
? loItem.Sku
loItem.Sku = "NewSku"
lnTotal = loItem.CalculateTotal()

*** Access non-accessible properties and methods indirectly
lnFlagValue = loBridge.GetProperty(loItem,"Flag")
lnFlagValue = loBridge.SetProperty(loItem,"Flag",5) 
loBridge.InvokeMethod(loItem,"PassFlagValue",lnFlagValue)
```

## Features at a glance
wwDotnetBridge provides the following enhancements over plain COM Interop:

* Access most .NET Components directly even those not marked [ComVisible]
* Requires no COM Registration
* Call any .NET method and set and get properties
* Call any .NET method asynchronously and get called back on completion
* Instantiate types with parameterized constructors
* Call overloaded methods using standard method names
* Support for many natively unsupported .NET types and values
* Access Static members, Value/Struct types, Generics, Binary, Guids, DbNulls
* Automatically fix up problematic .NET Types on method returns
* Provides easy Array access with ComArray helper class
* ComValue class to store results and parameters in .NET
* ComValue helps with problem .NET type conversions
* ComArray allows easy creation, updating and managing of Enumerable types
* Multi-threading library built-in 
* wwDotnetBridge can also work with regular COM Interop (w/o runtime hosting)

* [Change Log](https://github.com/RickStrahl/wwDotnetBridge/blob/master/Changelog.md)

## How it works
This library consists of 3 components (all provided in source):

* ClrHost.dll - Win32 Loader for the .NET Runtime
* wwDotnetBridge.dll  - .NET assembly Proxy and Helper
* wwDotnetBridge.prg - FoxPro front end to .NET Proxy

> #### Make sure DLLs can be found!
> Make sure CrlHost.dll (or wwIpstuff.dll for [commercial West Wind tools](https://west-wind.com/WestwindClientTools.aspx)) and wwDotnetBridge are accessible via the FoxPro path. Ideally you'll want to have these DLLs in your current executing path of the application - typically the root folder of the application.

If you're using FoxPro you can simply use the wwDotnetBridge.prg class to load an assembly and fire away at it or access existing .NET components directly.

This example loads the OpenPop .NET library and accesses a POP3 mailbox to display messages waiting:

```foxpro
*** Load library and initialize wwDotnetBridge
do wwDotNetBridge
LOCAL loBridge as wwDotNetBridge
loBridge = CreateObject("wwDotNetBridge")

*** Load an assembly from disk
loBridge.LoadAssembly("bin\OpenPop.dll")

*** Create an instance of a class - note: No COM registration
loPop = loBridge.CreateInstance("OpenPop.Pop3.Pop3Client")

*** This won't work due to overloads
* loPop.Connect("mail.server.net",587,.f.)

*** So, call indirectly instead
? loBridge.InvokeMethod(loPop,"Connect","mail.server.net",110,.f.)

*** Most methods/members do work directly
? loPop.Authenticate("jb007","seekrit")

lnCount =  loPop.GetMessageCount()
? StringFormat("{0} Messages",lnCount)

*** NOTE: OpenPop is 1 based because pop3 is 1 based!
** show last messages
FOR lnX = lnCount TO 1 STEP -1
   loHeader = loPop.GetMessageHeaders(lnx)
   ? loHeader.From.DisplayName
   ? "  " + loHeader.Subject
   ?
   IF lnX < lnCount - 10
      EXIT
   ENDIF
ENDFOR
```
The example demonstrates a few simple features: Loading an assembly, creating a .NET type instance and then calling methods and accessing properties either directly or indirectly. For many methods and properties on .NET object references you can directly access the members, but some members are not directly callable via COM if there are overloads on a method, if there are Generics, enums or Value Types involved in the method or member access. It's best to always try direct access first and if that fails attempt to use indirect access to the wwDotnetBridge instance.

In that case you can use indirect referencing to access members with:

* loBridge.InvokeMethod(instance,"Method",parm1,parm2..,parm15)
* loBridge.GetProperty(instance,"Property")  
* loBridge.SetProperty(instance,"Property",valueToSet)
* GetPropertyEx(),SetPropertyEx,InvokeMethodEx() which supported nested names for the member

These methods internally use Reflection to call .NET code, but because they run inside of .NET they can do many things that native COM interop cannot due to the limitations for type marshalling over COM and the incompatibilities of the FoxPro type system.

Here's another example that demonstrates a few more features including calling static methods and setting enum values and accessing collections using enumerators.

```foxpro
*** Load library
DO wwDotNetBridge

*** Create instance of wwDotnetBridge
LOCAL loBridge as wwDotNetBridge
loBridge = CreateObject("wwDotNetBridge","V4")

loStore = loBridge.CreateInstance("System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store")

? loBridge.cErrorMsg

*** Grab a static Enum value
leReadOnly = loBridge.GetEnumvalue("System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.OpenFlags.ReadOnly")

*** Use the enum value
loStore.Open(leReadOnly)   && 0 - if value is known

*** Returns a .NET Collection of store items
laCertificates = loStore.Certificates

*** Collections don't work over regular COM Interop
*** so use indirect access
lnCount = loBridge.GetProperty(laCertificates,"Count")

*** Loop through Certificates
FOR lnX = 0 TO lnCount -1
	*** Access collection item indirectly using extended syntax
	*** that supports nested objects and array/collection [] brackets
	LOCAL loCertificate as System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2	
	loCertificate = loBridge.GetPropertyEx(loStore,"Certificates[" + TRANSFORM(lnX) + "]")
			
	IF !ISNULL(loCertificate)
		? loCertificate.FriendlyName
		? loCertificate.SerialNumber
		? loCertificate.GetName()
		*? loBridge.GetPropertyEx(loCertificate,"IssuerName.Name")
	ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

You can also call any .NET method asynchronously and get called back when the method has completed executing:

```foxpro
DO wwDotnetBridge

LOCAL loBridge as wwDotnetBridge
loBridge = GetwwDotnetBridge("V4")

loHttp = loBridge.CreateInstance("System.Net.WebClient")


*** Create a callback object - object has to be 'global'
*** so it's still around when the callback returns
*** Use Public or attach to long lived object like form or _Screen
PUBLIC loCallback
loCallBack = CREATEOBJECT("HttpCallback")


*** Make the async call - returns immediately
loBridge.InvokeMethodAsync(loCallback, loHttp, ;
                        "DownloadData",;
                        "http://west-wind.com/files/HelpBuilderSetup.exe")

? "Download has started... running in background."

RETURN


*** Callback class 
DEFINE CLASS HttpCallback as Custom


FUNCTION OnCompleted(lvResult, lcMethod)

? "Http Call completed"
? "Received: " + TRANS(LEN(lvResult),"999,999,999")

lcFile = ADDBS(SYS(2023)) + "HelpBuilderSetup.exe"

*** Write to file to temp folder
STRTOFILE(lvResult,lcFile)

*** Launch the downloaded installer
TRY
	*** Open the Zip file
	DO wwutils
	GoUrl(lcFile)
CATCH
ENDTRY

ENDFUNC

FUNCTION OnError(lcErrorMessage, loException, lcMethod)
? lcErrorMessage
ENDFUNC

ENDDEFINE
```
